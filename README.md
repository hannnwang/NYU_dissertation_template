# NYU_dissertation_template
Dissertation template intended for PhD thesis of NYU. Modified by Aman Gupta and Han Wang, strongly based on the template downloaded at https://github.com/suchow/Dissertate.

Should work in Overleaf, as well as most other common Latex compilers.

## Getting started
1. Personalize the document by filling out your name and all the other info in documents under `frontmatter/`.
2. Begin writing your thesis using the chapter files in 'chapters/'. Fill in the chapter files as if you are writing a regular latex file. Packages to install and customized commands must be all typed into 'Dissertate.cls' by default. Add your bibliography and figure files to any paths you are comfortable with.
3. Modify the file names in 'dissertation.tex' so that they mach the file names of your real chapters under 'chapters/' and your bibiliography files
